## ðŸ’€ Assignment Pain Points
- Following: https://docs.churnkey.co/installing-churnkey
    -Step one: Asking to use YOUR_APP_ID
      - Where do I find my app id?
      - Ok, when following the embed instructions, it gives you the app_id (this could be clearer)
- Following: https://app.churnkey.co/settings/embed
    - Asking to use stripe_customer_id but without any context -> where should I obtain this?
        - there could be more context here in the docs; I obtained the stripe_customer_id by creating a test user within stripe, copying the id from stripe, and hardcoding the id into my code.
    - For Step One: Place embedded code
        - Would be easier to understand if there was a comment pointing out that your own personal app_id has been inserted into the code snippet
- In console, getting error: 
    - Error initializing Churnkey. This is typically due to a mismatched HMAC hash. Check the network logs for details.
      - I console logged my HMAC's from front and back end and saw that they did, in fact, match up.
      - My response in network logs:
        - "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'decorated')"
      - Finally, I stopped getting this error by changing mode from 'live' to 'test' within the window.churnkey.init
- In console, getting error:
    - No subscription found
    - My test user does not, in fact, have any subscriptions. Can add them if wanted!
